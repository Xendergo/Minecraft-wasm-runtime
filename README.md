# Wasm runtime

## Wuts this?
Wasm runtime is a mod that executes webassembly modules within minecraft using wasmtime

## Stuff to do
### Minecraft API
Idk, I'll just do whatever seems useful here, I'll probably just copy scarpet
### Other APIs
1. Web requests
2. Terminal commands?
3. File system

## API ideas
Spawning items
Creating loot tables to spawn items from (good for those videos that are like "manhunt but thingy drops op loot")
Some sort of equivalent to Javascript's `e.preventDefault()`
Manipulating nbt is definitely a must have
